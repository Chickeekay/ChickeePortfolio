        <p>In lieu of the covid-19 pandemic, the world was forced to work and study from home. This might be easy for some people but can be extremely hard for others, especially if you have your kids (or your parents) around. Hey, some kids prefer to study away from their parents too. It wasn’t my first choice either but I learned to love it.<br><br>

        Let me first give you a background on how I get started with working from home.  As I said, it wasn’t my first choice. My boyfriend (now my husband) is a world traveler. Wanting to explore the world with him, I needed to find ways to still earn while on the road. I’m a registered nurse in both the Philippines & in the USA when when started traveling together but my licenses were useless in other countries.  To be able to work in the nursing field, I had to study again and take the board exams of each country or region I want to work at. It is not feasible nor practical. So I tried teaching English in brick-and-mortar schools but it wasn’t feasible long term either. Then I switched to teaching English online. That was successful so I stuck with it.

        <br><br>

        How about studying from home? Seeing the advantages of working from home and enjoying the nomadic lifestyle, I decided to completely switch gears. While teaching English is fulfilling & profitable, I don’t see myself doing it for the long haul. During our travels, most of the long-term travelers we met work in the tech industry. Most of them were web developers. Coming from a family of mostly engineers and enjoying work as a tech support post-college, I thought, “Hey, web development might work for me too!” So that, along with other compelling reasons, propelled me to seriously explore the world of tech. Not long after, I enrolled in a UX Design program. Not just any UX Design program- it’s part design and part web development. The former is what I'm naturally good at, and the latter is what I thought was something I can learn quickly. The kicker? It’s 100% online! So not only was I working from home, I’d be studying from home too. Self-isolation at it’s finest. Or is it?

        </div> <figcaption>How it can feel sometimes.</figcaption><br>

        There are some differences between working from a home (staying long term in one place) and working nomadically (constant moving). I'll stick with talking about working from home here since that's what most people are experiencing now. If you're interested about my experience in working nomadically, send me a message so I can get into writing about it sooner. Anyhow, here are the things that kept me going with WFH and actually loving it.<br><br>

        <b>1. Trial and Error</b><br><br> No single approach works for everybody. Even the popular advice of having a separate office space inside the home. It doesn’t or can’t work for everybody. Some don’t even have the luxury of extra space to begin with. So you have to know what works for you.<br><br>

        Even if this might be a temporary setup because of the virus, it still pays to do the trial and error approach.<br><br>
        1) We don't know how long this pandemic lasts.<br>
        2) Once you know what works for you, it will be easier next time you need to WFH again. Bonus: It can be so effective and enjoyable that it can be a career changing move for you.<br><br>

        Another reason why I’m happy? I’m happy because I failed forward. Not counting staffing agencies and an informational interview with Facebook, my Microsoft interview was technically my first job interview on my quest to become a full-time UX Designer, and my first ever since I moved to US. It was a great experience! The recruiters were helpful, the interviewers were warm and professional, and my co-applicants (despite knowing were fighting for the same positions) were friendly and supportive.<br><br>

        Yes, I was disappointed I wasn’t chosen but I’m still really grateful for the experience. Failure is such an underrated part of the journey. I think it should be celebrated more. Success stories are so much more meaningful when we highlight the failures.</p><br><br>
