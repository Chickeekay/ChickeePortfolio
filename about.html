        <p>Excelled in <span class="yellow">arts and science</span> as a kid all the way through high school. I was constantly <span class="yellow">designing, creating, and experimenting</span> even as a hobby. I also discovered my obsession with <span class="yellow">cleaning and organizing</span> as early as 2nd grade.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would graciously fold my entire family's laundry, and group them by purpose, size, and colors. Once a week in high school, I would volunteer to clean and organize our classroom on my own. I could very well be Marie Kondo.

        <br>
        <br>
        This period coincided with the rise of digital cameras. I fell in love with <span class="yellow">photography</span> which led me to learn <span class="yellow">Adobe Photoshop</span> and other related softwares.
