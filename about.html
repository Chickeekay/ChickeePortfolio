            <p>I was born and raised in a <span class="yellow">family of engineers and healthcare professionals</span>. The year I was born, my country was just rising up from 14 years of martial law. So my younger years was surrounded by <span class="red">poverty</span>, yet guided by <span class="yellow">happy, resourceful, and hardworking people.</span>

            <h4>1990s - early 2000’s</h4>
            <p>Excelled in <span class="yellow">arts and science</span> as a kid all the way through high school. I was constantly <span class="yellow">designing, creating, and experimenting</span> even as a hobby. I also discovered my obsession with <span class="yellow">cleaning and organizing</span> as early as 2nd grade.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would graciously fold my entire family's laundry, and group them by purpose, size, and colors. Once a week in high school, I would volunteer to clean and organize our classroom on my own. I can very well be Marie Kondo.

            <p>Wanting to please my parents, I took <span class="yellow">BS Nursing.</span> Despite not being my first choice, it taught me a big deal about <span class="yellow">social psychology, empathy and customer service.</span> I eventually passed both the <span class="yellow">Philippine and California</span> licensure exams.
            <br>
            <br>
            This period coincided with the rise of digital cameras. I fell in love with <span class="yellow">photography</span> which led me to learn <span class="yellow">Adobe Photoshop</span> and other related softwares.

            Biggest lesson I got from the summit: <span class="yellow">Digital technology </span>is extremely powerful. In the right hands, it can change people’s lives for the better.
