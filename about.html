        <h4>1990s - early 2000’s</h4>
        <p>Excelled in <span class="yellow">arts and science</span> as a kid all the way through high school. I was constantly <span class="yellow">designing, creating, and experimenting</span> even as a hobby. I also discovered my obsession with <span class="yellow">cleaning and organizing</span> as early as 2nd grade.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would graciously fold my entire family's laundry, and group them by purpose, size, and colors. Once a week in high school, I would volunteer to clean and organize our classroom on my own. I could very well be Marie Kondo.

        <p>Mostly due to <span class="red">social & family pressure,</span>  I took a Bachelor's degree in<span class="yellow"> Nursing.</span> Despite not being my first choice, it taught me a big deal about <span class="yellow">psychology, empathy, and customer service.</span> I eventually passed both the <span class="yellow">Philippine and California</span> licensure exams.
        <br>
        <br>
        This period coincided with the rise of digital cameras. I fell in love with <span class="yellow">photography</span> which led me to learn <span class="yellow">Adobe Photoshop</span> and other related softwares.
