### My personal UX Design portfolio

This is a culmination of what I've been studying in the past 2 years. When I started my UX program with Bloc, I have never heard of Sketch or Figma or Github. The closest I got to code is through a 2-hr free introductory HTML/CSS class in Galvanize Seattle which includes typing the phrase "Hello World" and adding a photo of me on the screen. So being able to code a whole page, let a alone a whole portfolio, blows mind!

As a nurse, this is totally out of the scope of my training. Btw, did I mention that back in high school, in my computer class, we were taught how to create an email account & to decifer the meaning of LOL, BRB & ASL?!

## About My Portfolio

For the theme of my portfolio, I took what I learned from my Branding & Identity classes and started with a mind map. 

The recurring themes from it were:
- Minimalist
- Yellow
- Strong
- Fun
- Environment

These shaped up my design goal.

## Design Goals

| Goal | Reason |
| :-------: | :--------------: |
| **Dark theme** | Minimalist and environmentally friendly. In OLED screens, dark pixels save more energy. <br><br>Differentiator from other UX designer portfolios | 
| **Black, White, and Gray with pops of Primary Colors (Yellow, Red, and Blue)** | Minimalist, Chickadee colors<br><br>Philippine flag colors |
| **Basic shapes and clean lines** | Minimalist<br><br>Strong<br><br>Child-like (reminiscent of baby shape sorter toy)|
| **Negative space** | Minimalist<br><br>Efficient|
| **Tribal symbols and patterns from the Philippines** |Clean lines, bold shapes. Represents my heritage.|
