            <p>I was born and raised in a <span class="yellow">family of engineers and healthcare professionals</span>. The year I was born, my country was just raising up from 14 years of martial law. So my younger years was surrounded by <span class="red">poverty</span>. yet guided by <span class="yellow">happy, resourceful, and hardworking people.</span>

            <h4>1990s - early 2000’s</h4>
            <p>Excelled in arts and science as a kid all the way through high school. I was constantly designing, creating, and experimenting even as a hobby. I also discovered my obsession with cleaning and organizing as early as 2nd grade.

            I would graciously fold my entire family's laundry, and group them by purpose, size, and colors. Once a week in high school, I would volunteer to clean and organize our classroom on my own. I can very well be Marie Kondo.

            <h4 class="right">2004 - 2007</h4>
            <p>Pressured by my parents, I took BS Nursing. Despite not being my first choice, it taught me a big deal about social psychology, empathy and customer service. I eventually passed both the Philippine and US licensure exams.

            This period coincided with the rise of digital cameras. I fell in love with photography which led me to learn Adobe Photoshop and other related software.

            <h4>2007 - 2008</h4>
            <p>Global recession hit. The worldwide demand for nurses declined. I took a temporary job as an HP laptop tech support for American and Canadian customers. I enjoyed it. I also landed a job with a similar role with an Australian telco company later on.

            <p>Went back to nursing. Worked in the Middle East and was abused by my employer. Went back to the Philippines to start a new. I decided that from then on, I’m going to follow where my heart leads me.

            <h4>2012 - 2016</h4>
            <p>I got involved in entrepreneurship. Volunteered as a photographer/designer for various projects. Worked in the life and health insurance industry. I enjoyed the finance aspect of it.
            <br>
            Moved to Vietnam with my then boyfriend to be his marketing arm for his language school. The business didn't pan out. Taught English to kids in person and coached adult test-takers online. Lived in Malaysia and Singapore.

            <p>I applied for and was selected to represent my country at the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit @ Standford University. Visa denied but I was still able to attend the sessions remotely.

            Biggest lesson I got from the summit: Digital technology is extremely powerful. In the right hands, it can change people’s lives for the better.

            This propelled me to take a serious look at the tech industry.

            <p>After 8 years of 3 visa denials, I was finally granted access to US. Lived in Seattle to explore my options in the tech industry. Attended and volunteered in meetups and hackathons.  Stumbled upon UX Design. I eventually enrolled in Bloc’s Designer Program.
